                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">For my third print I was tasked to add anything to an existing print using Tinkercad. So I chose to add things to the 3D Benchy boat. I wanted to make a small diorama for the boat. During my sketch I wanted a nice base that could stick to the bed of the 3D printer well and then I wanted to make another surface for the boat to make it look like water. Finally to add some action I sketched out shark fins around the boat.</p>

                        </body>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Now I have to design it in Tinkercad. My first thought on Tinkcad was that it was very user friendly and I picked up the skills in using it very quickly. It also had 3d shapes and other figures ready for you to choose. So for the base I used a cylinder to make the base, as for the water surface I tried to use a dome shape but it didn’t look natural so instead I switched to a sphere. I flattened the sphere onto the cylinder which gave the edges a gap which made it look more realistic. As for the shark fins I used cones and flattened them on the sides. Afterwards, I was exploring the selections of shapes Tinkercad already made and I found that they had figures of people and I wanted to add it into my diorama. So I made the person float on the surface by adding a donut shaped circle around the person. When I finished my design I checked to see if they were all connected to each other, which they were. Then I downloaded it into a STL file which I put into Prusa Slicer. It came out pretty big so I scaled it down to 75%. The print time was 1hr 14min, using 22.62g of filament.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">When the print came out, it was almost perfect. I noticed that the sphere that mimics the ocean was off centered from the base and I don’t think the base was a perfect circle. In Tinkercad it did look like a circle but I guess it was hard to tell. Some minor troubleshoots that I noticed was that the bow had some warping, there was also a little layer separation between one of the fins and the water, and lastly there was some minor stringing. Overall, the print turned out very good.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">For my fourth print I wanted to make the water the action, so I started with a huge wave for my sketch. Keeping it simple because I am using Fusion for the first time I wanted to focus on designing the wave. I will just add a few boats on the wave after. The first time opening Fusion I was hit with a lot of functions each with different jobs. I had to watch a few tutorials and youtube videos to find the functions that would help me design a wave.</p>

                        </body>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">First I went to Create Sketch, then it popped out different types of lines. The one I chose was Fit Point Spline which creates a curve line when you put down a point. I realized that putting more points would make it more flexible and the closer the point is to one another the straighter the line will be. After making a 2D sketch of the wave I wanted to make it into a 3D shape. The term for that is called extruding. After that I added a few boats on the wave. To insert it into Fusion I have to make it into a mesh then I can turn it into a solid. I wanted to put it at different angles just to see how it would print out.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">I downloaded the file onto Prusa Slicer. It was way bigger than the bed so I had to scale it down to 15%. Because of the overhang of the wave I had to add supports to it. I was recommended organic supports, I changed the settings of the supports to 50° for overhang threshold and the branch diameter was 1mm.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">When the print came out it had a lot of stringing between the boats. There were also small features that did not print out for the boats. They were boat shaped but it did not have all the details of the benchy boat. As for the wave it was pretty good but there was minor warping and blobs. Overall, my design from Fusion turned out pretty good. Next time I would want to size up the boats a little bit bigger so it would be much easier for it to print out the details of the boats. Or instead of adding the supports everywhere I could have selected the supports only touching the bed because there were some supports that were for the boats which I think was also a factor of the boats not being able to print out well.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;"> From this project I learned how to add to designs using Tinkercad and Fusion. At first I liked how Tinkercad was very user friendly and had many different shapes prepared for you to use. Then after learning about Fusion I thought that Fusion was way more powerful but it took some time to learn about some of the features it had. I haven’t fully grasped the full functionality of Fusion yet but I believe that I will go to this software when I want to design a print.</p>
