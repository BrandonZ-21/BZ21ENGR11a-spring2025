                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Starting off with the third project of the class I learned a new skill which was soldering. For this project my partner and I were tasked to build a smart tracking car kit. We had to solder wires, lights, resistors, capacitors, and many more. To solder you want to cover the tip of the soldering iron with solder then melt the solder wire with the solder iron onto the circuit board and you don’t want to put the tip on the circuit board for too long or else it can burn it. I thought that building the kit went very smoothly. There were some steps that we had to double check a few times before we soldered it down. I learned that to differentiate which side is the positive or negative side you had to look at which side of the wire is longer. The longer side is the positive side.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Also we made sure we put the right resistor in the right spot by looking at the color stripes on it. After finishing the build we did some minor adjustments to the gears because sometimes it wasn’t touching the worm on the motor shaft. So we tried to bend the shaft towards the gear and adjusted the gear to be in the center of the worm so the worm can spin the gear most of the time. We also played around with the potentiometer, we figured out if we turn both potentiometers to the right it was going rocking left and right at a slower interval and if we turn both to the left it did not bother to follow the black line and just kept going forward. So in the end we turned both of the potentiometers around 45° to the right for the right one and left for the left one. This made the car rock at a faster interval while also following the black line. I notice that it is only a right wheel drive and when it needs to adjust it will use the left wheel to turn it back on course, that's why it rocks left and right when it drives because it's constantly adjusting itself.</p>

                        <h2>Designing a chassis enclosure:</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">After finishing the kit we started to brainstorm what type of chassis will fit on our kit. It needed a fit on the kit while having room for the wheels to move, not blocking any sensors for lights, having easy access to the batteries, and the on-off button. The first thing that came into mind was designing a car chassis, more specifically a convertible style chassis. The open roof will give easy access to the batteries and the on-off button. Also with car-like features it will have space for the wheels to move and lights to show.</p>

                        </body>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Our next step was to measure the whole car. We used a calibrator to get specific measurements. We did run into trouble with trying to make a collaborative space where my partner and I can design the chassis in the same space on Fusion. So while trying to solve this problem my partner created a 2D sketch of how the chassis is going to be laid out by using the sketch line feature on Fusion. Then used the extrude feature to create the walls of the chassis. I did add to the design but in the end my partner could not see my changes which in the end led to my partner building up the chassis while I gave some ideas and changes to our design. Later on we figured out that we can make a folder and share it to each other but we still couldn’t make changes on each other’s designs. After finishing the 3D model of the chassis on Fusion we download it as a stl file so we can upload it on to Prusa Slicer.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">Our first print came out pretty good with some minor issues with the supports. I knew I had to add supports to our print because the inside was hollow but I guess I forgot to change the type of support to organic supports. Instead it had snug supports which made it very hard to take out after the print was finished. I tried using snippers and a file and I still couldn’t get the supports out. Some trouble shoots it had were there were separation between the walls especially at the top. I believe this happened because the top was very thin so it did not stick well with each other. Another issue was that we forgot to add holes to the front of the chassis so we went back to Fusion to edit it but for our first print we got the main structure of our design. We just had to do some minor corrections to the designs.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">For our second print I believe this was our most successful print out of the three we did. We fixed the front by adding in the two holes for the lights and changed the type of support to organic support. And made it so it only had supports on the build plate and not on the print. The outcome was much better than the first print but I still believe the walls of the chassis were still too thin because there was still separation between the walls. When we put it on the kit it fit, it was just a bit loose because we didn’t have a back wall putting pressure on the motors so it was sliding around.</p>

                        <h3>Third Print:</h3>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">After looking at our first and second print our main issue now is that the walls were not connecting to each other so we made the sides thicker. We also made the front taller because for the second print it was touching the capacitors. But we wanted the chassis to rest on the circuit board instead of any electronics. For the settings on Pusa Slicer it was the same thing as our second print with organic supports. When the third print was finished it was worse than our second print. It had gaps on the top layer, it had lines on the side of the print, and there was more separation than the first and second print. Since with all of these trouble shoots it made the chassis very weak so I couldn’t take off all the organic supports or else it might break the overall structure.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">After designing a chassis using 3D printers we moved on to laser cutting. This was our first time in this class being able to use the laser cutter. I was very excited! Because it was a powerful machine we first went over the safety precautions of the machines. Some of the safety precautions were that all the vents must be open and on, you have to know how to shut the machine down if the object in the laser cutter catched on fire, you always want a person looking at the machine while it's on, and make sure you have some sort of extinguisher close by incase of a fire. These are only a brief summary of the safety precautions. Now because we are using a different machine we have to download a different software called LightBurn. This is where you put the 2D object in so the laser cutter can cut it out. So, our first design was a plane box with links on it. We first designed it on Fusion then we exported the sketch of each side as a dxf file onto LightBurn. Our first cut came out successfully and we use 3mm thick acrylic. But when we glued it together and tried to put it on the kit it wasn’t wide enough.</p>

                            <img src="assets/LaserCar/FrontBox1.jpg" alt="Description of the image" class="clickable-image" onclick="enlargeImage()">

                        </script>
                        </body>
                        <p style="text-indent:30px;">So we went back to Fusion and made it wider, we also added another square cut on the top so we can access the batteries and switch. For the second cut we use 3mm thick plywood. The cut also came out successfully. When we glued it together it fit on the kit but it had nowhere to rest on so it was supported by the capacitors in the front.</p>

                        <p style="text-indent:30px;"> Overall, I got the hang of soldering. I learned a lot more about Fusion and new features I discovered on it. Some changes I want to do in the future for the 3D chassis are that instead of building panels on the chassis I would start off with a solid and cut into it so maybe it will connect better. I also learned a new software called LightBurn. This was my first time using it, at first it was kind of hard to picture a 2D design for our 3D chassis. Something that I would change for our laser cut chassis was add holes in the front so the lights can be seen and figure out a mount so that the chassis wouldn’t have to rest on the capacitors. I can’t wait to do more with laser cutting!</p>
